# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction

This project predicts Bitcoin prices using historical data with Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

## Dataset
Uses historical Bitcoin price data (Date, Open, Close, High, Low, Volume). Source: [Insert Data Source].

## Model
- Preprocessing: normalization, missing data handling.
- Model: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.
- Evaluation Metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Results
The model predicts Bitcoin prices with a Mean Squared Error of [add value]. A comparison plot of predicted vs actual prices is provided in the results.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
